Technical test - Voodoo Playable ads developer

## Work in progress... :construction:


## To do

Make [Flip Dunk](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/flip-dunk/id1459811607) playable ads core loop.


#### Optional :

- [ ] Less than 2,5MO
- [ ] Compress in a single HTML page without extern assets


## My Method & Feeling

#### Method :

Make the playground in Blender, it's faster and prettier.

Export all 3D models in .glb files, it's smaller and made for the web.

Split the code in small methods for more visibility, maintainability and to be reuse.

Can't fail in this playable, give more CPI sometimes, and faster to code (:

#### Feeling :

I love Three.JS, it's not new but re-make a playable gave me great pleasure and motivation, it gave me more reason to do my best for join the Voodoo team.
