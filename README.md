Technical test - Voodoo Playable ads developer


## To do

Make [Flip Dunk](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/flip-dunk/id1459811607) playable ads core loop.


#### Optional :

- [ ] Less than 2,5MO
- [ ] Compress in a single HTML page without extern assets


## My Method & Feeling

#### Method :

Make the playground in Blender, it's faster and prettier. Export all 3D models in .glb files, it's smaller and made for the web. Split the code in small methods for more visibility, maintainability and to be reuse.


#### Feeling :

I love Three.JS, it's not new but re-make a playable gave me great pleasure and motivation, it gave me more reason to do my best for join the Voodoo team.


## Improvements

- Add flip animation like in the game
- Best algo for jumping
- Smaller 3D models and player model with all animations
- Replay mode or second level

#### Fetaures ?

Have some holidays playgrounds. Here it's a bit creepy, can be improve for Halloween playable ads.

```
npm install
```

Run local server :
```
npm start
