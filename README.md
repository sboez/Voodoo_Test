Technical test - Voodoo Playable ads developer

## Work in progress... :construction:


## To do

Make [Flip Dunk](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/flip-dunk/id1459811607) playable ads.

#### Optional

- [ ] Less than 2,5MO
- [ ] Compress in a single HTML page without extern assets

## My method 

Make the scene with Blender, it's faster and prettier

Export all 3D models in .glb files, it's smaller and made for the web

Split the code in small methods for more visibility, maintainability and to be reuse


## Usage

Install dependencies :
```
npm install
```

Run local server :
```
npm start
```
